## Team Information

**UB creators** team.


## Notes

// TODO: Implement configurator for server and logger:
    - Base DNS IP address
    - Port number to start server
    - Base logfile path and name
    - Maximum size of log file
// TODO: To fix two bugs:
    1. Logger creates new log file every time, program starts
    2. Server needs to be sender and reciever, because client waits for it's answer, but gets nothing
